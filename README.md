# ACM India Summer School on Detection and Analysis of Malware

## Topic: Web Security

This repository contains slides and demo code for the module on web client and server vulnerabilities. 

### Web Client Security
See the demos/ sub-directory for the demo code related to web client security. 

You should also install some simple webserver. I use Python 3's http.server module. To use this, first install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then run the following command from the demos/html directory.

    $ python -m http.server

### Web Server Security

For web server vulnerabilities, we will use the [Damn Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA). It is suggested that you install the DVWA inside a VirtualBox VM using the docker container provided at the GitHub link. Specifically, run the following command:

    $ dockerhub page docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
