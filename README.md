# ACM India Summer School on Detection and Analysis of Malware

## Topic: Web Security

This repository contains slides and demo code for the module on web client and server vulnerabilities. 

### Web Client Security
See the code/ sub-directory for the demo code related to web client security. 

### Web Server Security

For web server vulnerabilities, we will use the [Damn Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA). It is suggested that you install the DVWA inside a VirtualBox VM using the docker container provided at the GitHub link. Specifically, run the following command:

    $ dockerhub page docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
